# Problem Statement:
To create a universal Proof of Reception (PoR) profile identification system, consolidating personal data under unique identities for secure and transparent control and monetization. PoR technology will ensure that data transactions are securely recorded and comply with privacy regulations. By integrating with MyTiki's hashed emails and payment profiles and using AI-based entity matches, the project aims to improve data integration and consistency. The ultimate goal is to establish a sustainable data framework that empowers users to reclaim their data rights and prevent unauthorized exploitation.
